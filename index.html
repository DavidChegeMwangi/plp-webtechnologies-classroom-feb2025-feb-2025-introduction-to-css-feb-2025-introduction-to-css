    Beavers are the unhinged CSS developers of the wild—tiny, bucktoothed lunatics slapping mud and sticks together like they’ve just discovered display: grid and absolutely lost their minds. They gnaw through trees like a frustrated coder deleting their stylesheet for the sixth time, muttering, “I’ll just start over, it’ll be cleaner.” Watching a beaver build a dam is like watching someone try to center a div with margin: auto in 2007—chaotic, emotional, and somehow involving tears and water. And yet, damn it, it works. The stream stops, the layout aligns, and you're left wondering how this rabid little lumberjack just did something that took you three Stack Overflow threads and a nervous breakdown.
